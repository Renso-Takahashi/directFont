# directWideFont V3 update 1 (directFont Extended)

This is an Updated+Extended version made by Wyrdgirn (me) of the directFont plugin v2.2 created by DK22Pac.


The initial objective was to add support for Latin characters (Spanish, Portuguese...) but now my goal is to give support to more languages which need a set of UNICODE characters which the game does not support natively, for this I use a translator that detects a text and replaces it on the fly with a UNICODE one, thus allowing you to replace any text in the game simply by editing a text file...

For now the WIDE Translator support all tokens available in the original directFont...

The WIDE translator is loaded as a separate function allowing the game to still process its original texts, that way the game is able to use both UNICODE characters and non-UNICODE characters...



For now, these would be the changes from DK22Pak v2.2:

- Changed version to v3.1 (V3 Update 1)
- New Latin translator (Internal) (sure but may still contain errors)
- New custom translator: allows you to load a character set from a file. Each file has an individual character set for each font, allowing you to change characters from one font without altering that of the others...
- New WIDE translator: Allows you to replace texts on the fly in addition to supporting UNICODE characters. With it you can bring the game to almost any language (for example Japanese or Chinese) just by editing a simple **.ini** file
- Fixed some problems with the subtitles which were not kept correctly aligned vertically (still need some fixes...)
- Maybe some improvements soon...
